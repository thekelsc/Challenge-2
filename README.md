# Challenge-2
Kelsey Creveling's Profile 

In this Challenge Assignment for the UofU-VIRT-BO-FSF-PT-10-2020-U-B-TTH Coding Bootcamp Due Sunday 11/8/2020 at 11:59 pm, I was tasked with creating a profile webpage from scratch to showcase my development skills and current projects. With a goal of creating a viable place where employers may view my development work. 

I began by wireframing the desired website design, before creating the shell HTML, and shell css. By doing this it allowed Class naming to be much easier. 

The page while not yet beautiful, does reflect my company's logo, branding, and general aesthetic.
